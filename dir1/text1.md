# Text 1: Introduction to the Topic

This is the first document in Directory 1.

## Basic Concepts

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. In the context of our study, we define the relationship between variables as $y = f(x)$ where $f$ represents the transformation function.

### Key Principles

When working with these concepts, remember:

1. Consistency is critical
2. Validation must be performed at each step
3. The principle of $\alpha + \beta = \gamma$ should be maintained

## Mathematical Foundation

The core of our approach is based on the following equation:

$$
\mathcal{L}(x) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \cdot g(x) \, dx
$$

Where:
- $f(x)$ represents the primary function
- $g(x)$ is the weighting function
- $[a, b]$ is our interval of interest

## Implementation

Here's a basic implementation of these concepts:

```python
def calculate_integral(f, g, a, b, steps=1000):
    """Calculate the numerical integral of f(x)*g(x) from a to b."""
    dx = (b - a) / steps
    result = 0
    
    for i in range(steps):
        x = a + i * dx
        result += f(x) * g(x) * dx
        
    return result

# Example usage
def f(x): return x**2
def g(x): return math.sin(x)

result = calculate_integral(f, g, 0, math.pi, steps=10000)
print(f"The result is approximately {result:.6f}")
```

## Next Steps

After understanding these basic concepts, you'll be ready to explore the more advanced topics covered in [Text 2](text2).
