# Text 2: Advanced Concepts

This document builds on the concepts introduced in [Text 1](text1).

## Advanced Applications

When extending our basic principles to complex systems, we need to consider the multi-dimensional nature of the problem. Instead of simple functions $f(x)$, we now work with vector fields $\vec{F}(x,y,z)$.

### Vector Calculus

The divergence theorem states:

$$
\iiint_V (\nabla \cdot \vec{F}) \, dV = \oiint_S \vec{F} \cdot \hat{n} \, dS
$$

This relates the flux of a vector field through a closed surface to the divergence of the field within the volume enclosed.

## Practical Example

Consider a system modeled by the following equation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u
$$

This is the wave equation, where:
- $u$ represents displacement
- $t$ is time
- $c$ is the wave propagation speed
- $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator

### Numerical Solution

```python
def solve_wave_equation_2d(width, height, c, dt, T):
    """
    Solve the 2D wave equation using finite differences.
    
    Parameters:
    width, height - dimensions of the domain
    c - wave propagation speed
    dt - time step
    T - total simulation time
    """
    dx = dy = 1.0
    nx, ny = int(width / dx), int(height / dy)
    
    # Stability condition check
    assert dt <= dx / (c * math.sqrt(2)), "Stability condition not met"
    
    # Initialize arrays
    u = np.zeros((3, nx, ny))  # 3 time levels: n-1, n, n+1
    
    # Set initial conditions (e.g., a point disturbance)
    u[1, nx//2, ny//2] = 1.0
    
    # Time-stepping loop
    steps = int(T / dt)
    for t in range(1, steps):
        for i in range(1, nx-1):
            for j in range(1, ny-1):
                # Second-order central difference in space and time
                u[2, i, j] = 2*u[1, i, j] - u[0, i, j] + \
                            (c*dt/dx)**2 * (u[1, i+1, j] + u[1, i-1, j] + \
                                           u[1, i, j+1] + u[1, i, j-1] - 4*u[1, i, j])
        
        # Shift time levels
        u[0] = u[1].copy()
        u[1] = u[2].copy()
    
    return u[1]  # Return the final state
```

## Connecting Theories

The connection between our basic framework from [Text 1](text1) and these advanced concepts can be summarized by the relationship:

$$
\mathcal{F}\{f(t)\} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i2\pi ft} \, dt
$$

This Fourier transform provides the bridge between time and frequency domains, allowing us to analyze complex systems from multiple perspectives.
